# Module Configuration
Module configuration is a yaml file that holds all the possible configuration
for the labs in a repository. The file has to be named `_modules.yml` and the structure and possible contents of this file can be seen [here](_modules.yml). The contents for this file will depend on the content for the workshop, as it will contain all the possible variables that can be used as well as the labs/modules.
